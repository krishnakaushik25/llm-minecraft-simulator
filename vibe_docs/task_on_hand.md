## üìã PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

### Project Name

**Web-Based Minimalistic Minecraft with LLM**

### Project Description

Build a minimalistic Minecraft-like game that:
- Runs entirely in the web browser
- Integrates Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities
- Provides a simplified voxel-based building and exploration experience
- Uses LLM for game assistance, commands, or world generation

### Target Users

- Minecraft enthusiasts who want a web-based experience
- Developers interested in AI-powered gaming
- Users who want an accessible, no-install gaming experience

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Playable Minecraft-like experience in browser
- ‚úÖ Functional LLM integration
- ‚úÖ Real-time 3D voxel rendering
- ‚úÖ Basic building, mining, and exploration mechanics

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Technology Stack (To Be Confirmed)

- **Frontend**: JavaScript (Three.js for 3D), HTML5, CSS3
- **LLM Integration**: WebLLM (browser-based LLM inference)
- **3D Engine**: Three.js + voxel engine
- **Build Tool**: Vite or Parcel for development
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

### Constraints

- **Platform**: Web browser only (no downloads)
- **Performance**: Real-time 3D rendering + LLM inference
- **Compatibility**: Modern browsers with WebGL/WebGPU support
- **Size**: Minimalistic approach to keep bundle size reasonable

## ‚ùì OPEN QUESTIONS

### High Priority Questions (Need immediate answers) ‚úÖ ANSWERED

1. **LLM Integration Purpose**: How should the LLM be used in the game?
   - ‚úÖ **DECISION**: Start with AI Building Assistant (help with crafting, building tips)
   - Future: Add procedural generation and natural language commands

2. **Game Scope**: What core Minecraft features should be included?
   - ‚úÖ **DECISION**: Start with BASIC scope, design for advancement
   - **Phase 1**: Basic building (place/remove blocks), player movement, simple world
   - **Phase 2**: Resource gathering, basic inventory
   - **Phase 3**: Crafting system, multiple block types
   - **Future**: Survival elements, multiplayer capabilities

3. **Development Preferences**: Do you have specific technology preferences?
   - ‚úÖ **DECISION**: Three.js + WebLLM, modern clean aesthetic, desktop-first

### CURRENT FOCUS: START BASIC, BUILD EXTENSIBLE

- Basic voxel world with player movement
- Simple block placement/removal system
- AI assistant for building tips and guidance
- Modular architecture for easy feature addition

### Technical Questions

1. Should this support mobile devices or desktop-only?
2. What's the target world size (small chunks vs large worlds)?
3. Should game state be persistent or session-based?
4. Any preference for LLM model size vs performance trade-offs?
